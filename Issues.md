Architecture Issues
==========================

# Solved

For the most part, we did not struggle very much with the architecture. Between the 3 of us, we have a lot of experience building similar systems (web applications), so we drew a lot from our past mistakes and successes.

That being said, the largest issue we had was wrapping our head around doing an architecture that wasn't really object oriented. In most of the examples we read about, the systems were really focused around hierarchies of objects. While we have Build objects, for the most part, our system is distributed across a variety of prebuilt components (there's no need to build a web server from scratch). Therefore, this left us in a situation where our architecture was primarily about putting together the right pieces. At first, we didn't understand if this would be OK, but after talking to Mark, everything was cleared up.

# Outstanding

At the moment, we have no outstanding issues. Hopefully, after the review some will appear.
