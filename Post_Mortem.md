# Post Mortem for Rosie Architecture

# Creating Initial Architecture

  Our approach to the initial architecture was to have all of our team members create an individual architecture and then to combine them. This was an effective strategy which resulted in a much better, complete architecture, but we had some pieces where the naming conventions were different and we had a few inconsistencies in our initial architecture as a result.

# Component Design

  Some of our component decisions were dictated by the familiarity we have with certain tools, and our explanations of those decisions seemed awkwardly incomplete to our reviewers. Though our justification has not changed, we could have been more clear about why experience made our decision instead of features.

# Reviewing Floradex Design

  We were hurried to write our design review because we volunteered to go early and work with the team that had done an early architecture. As we discussed after the review, our communications with Floradex were sparser than would have been ideal because Floradex had not appointed a specific person to talk to us and so it became a conversation between one person and a busy committee instead of between a member of each team. We were able to review their architecture completely in time for the meeting, but there could have been better communication with the other team so that they had made some simple changes to make the review more meaningful.
  The actual meeting went well, though we had discussed all of the issues beforehand and so forgot to explicitly vote on everything as we talked about it. We should have remembered the format better but we felt that our points were communicated clearly.

# Being Reviewed by Floradex

  We had worried that the technical gap between Floradex and Rosie would pose a problem in this review, but the issues they were able to raise were useful and they did not seem to have a major problem understanding what we were doing and how we were doing it. It might have been more ideal to pair with a team working on something more similar, but it seems that among the projects in the class, none is that close to what we are doing so Floradex is as good an option as existed.

# Issues

  Most of the issues which Floradex pointed out were superficial and easy to correct. Many of them were simply inconsistencies or missing details due to the fragmented nature of our original approach. These were easy to fill in and it was great to have another team's eyes to see the things we took for granted. Writing up the review of these was similarly easy.

# Overall Project

  This project came at a very busy time in the semester, so several of the stages felt rushed. Despite this, we were able to both write, be reviewed on, and revise a meaningful architecture which we are pretty happy with. The review process was useful despite our concerns and we learned a lot from being on both sides of the review panel.
